54,hock2018,Locate Available Reactive Resources Near Voltage Violations,"The pie chart symbols on the map (Fig.6) represent reactive resources: green color for compensation, brown color for charging. Light beige and light green identify the amount of reactive resources, which is still not used, but is available at the station. If all reactive resources at a station are fully available, then the pie chart is presented as a circle filled entirely with only one color. Thus, green and beige filled circles indicate the switched off reactive reserves, which can be made available on demand. The stations without any reactive resources and without any availability of reactive resources are not displayed at all on the map in order to avoid clutter and distraction. Voltage violations are shown as blue and red triangles indicating low and high voltage violation. The pop-up window provides the essential information about station parameters and location. Also, the one-line diagram with detailed information (i.e. breaker statuses, flows, and voltages) is accessible via a hyperlink “More info” in the pop-up window (Fig.2 and Fig.6). The geographical presentation of reactive resources does not replace optimal power flow analysis, but it improves the situation awareness for voltage management and provides geographical options for available reactive reserves in the vicinity of violations. For example, a low voltage violation is likely to be remedied by switching on capacitor banks or switching off reactive shunts, which are electrically close to the violation. Unlike line overloads, there is a short time for resolving dangerous low voltage violations, because they may quickly unfold into voltage collapse. Therefore, addressing voltage violations well in advance of their occurrence and in the context of estimated reactive reserves is an important advantage of the predictive analysis and future state visualization. ""a quick visual association of reactive resource availability in the geographical vicinity of voltage violation can be very helpful in the resolution of voltage problems"" (page 6) ""The pie chart symbols on the map (Fig.6) represent reactive resources: green color for compensation, brown color for charging.

The height of each cylinder is proportional to the number of violations caused by the contingency, while the shading and radius of the cylinder are proportional to the magnitude of the worst violation. The voltage cylinder is stacked on top of the transmission cylinder if a contingency causes both low voltages and overloads (which is the case for two of the contingencies shown in the figure). The doubling coding of the magnitudes of the worst contingent violations by color shade and cylinder radius helps to focus attention on these contingencies. A discrete color mapping is adopted from the consideration of its ease in distinguishing values in different small ranges over continuous color coding. The correspondence between the value ranges and the colors is shown by the color key. The severity of the problem contingencies can be compared through the heights and radii of the cylinders. The encoded color of the cylinders would help to overcome the potential vagueness due to the perspective effect in 3-D visualisation where a distant cylinder with larger width/height may seem thinner/shorter than another one closer but with smaller width/height. With the help of the color key, the per-unit or percentage range, in which the lowest voltage or the worst overloading lies under each problem contingency, can be read out from the color of the cylinders. The Fig. 1 color mapping was designed so more severe violations (lower voltage or higher loading) have darker or brighter colors while less severe violations have lighter colors. This helps to focus attention on the more severe contingencies. To give further attention to the most severe contingencies, one could also modify the transparency of the 3-D objects, according to the worst violation or some other severity index.
