The height of each cylinder is proportional to the number of violations caused by the contingency, while the shading and radius of the cylinder are proportional to the magnitude of the worst violation. The voltage cylinder is stacked on top of the transmission cylinder if a contingency causes both low voltages and overloads (which is the case for two of the contingencies shown in the figure).

In particular, an efficient clustering algorithm associated with a novel visualization for time-varying series as well as multiple and coordinated views is developed to locate faulted buses intuitively and quickly; strong need for operators to have a protection system to detect and locate these faults in a timely manner; the progressive analysis procedure should be consisted of 3 phases: i) detecting faults by visualizing a large body of bus voltages in the temporal space, ii) locating faulted buses by voltage contours in the spatial space, and iii) verifying the fault in a feature-temporal space by a view of various bus-related variables.",operators,"locate faulted buses intuitively and quickly. An engineer looks at the overview of the data sets (a), detects one potentially faulted cluster (b), then locates buses of interest (c), and finally verifies if a bus is the origin of the fault (d).","a filter is provided for engineers to select buses that most likely lead to faults. They are able to choose a group of buses and look deeply into patterns of multiple features to identify potential faulted buses; overview and the contour map are dynamically linked, making it more straightforward and comprehensible of both views. When a group of curves are selected (see Fig. 7(b)), corresponding contours are displayed on the map. Moreover, a dynamic linking from the feature matrix to the map is devised. When the feature pattern of a certain bus is abnormal, the engineer can click the bus name on the left of a feature pattern to highlight the corresponding node and the transmission lines on the map (see Fig. 7(c)). Zoom-in and zoom-out functions are also provided for engineers to explore the contour map",assumed transmission,40000,,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,"CORE I: presents a progressive visual analytics procedure (i.e., overview, detecting faulted bus candidates, locating buses, and looking into bus details) to detect fault location and figure out possible faulted buses.

They also provide information about existing margins of loadability for a given line. Note that real power is more related to phase angles, it typically flows from the bus having relatively high phase angle to the bus with a smaller phase angle. So, the mountain shaped terrain provides the user a quick overview of the distribution of real power flows in the power system: real power flows from the higher tower to the lower tower along the transmission lines. This is analogous to water flow in a similar terrain with water pipes.
